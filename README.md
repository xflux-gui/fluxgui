f.lux indicator applet
======================
Better lighting for your computer

The f.lux indicator applet `fluxgui` is an indicator applet to control
`xflux`, an application that makes the color of your computer's
display adapt to the time of day, warm at nights and like sunlight
during the day. Reducing blue light exposure in the evening can help
you fall asleep at night. See https://justgetflux.com/research.html
for more details.

This project -- https://github.com/xflux-gui/xflux-gui -- is only
concerned with the `fluxgui` indicator applet program, not with the
underlying `xflux` program the indicator applet controls. The `xflux`
program is responsible for actually changing the color of your
screen. See https://justgetflux.com/linux.html for more information
about `xflux`.
